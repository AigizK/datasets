The Training split consists of 3,318,333 image-URL/caption pairs, with a total number of 51,201 total token types in the captions (i.e., total vocabulary). The average number of tokens per captions is 10.3 (standard deviation of 4.5), while the median is 9.0 tokens per caption.

We also present quantitative evaluations of a number of image captioning models and show that a model architecture based on Inception-ResNetv2 (Szegedy et al., 2016) for image-feature extraction and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) for sequence modeling achieves the best performance when trained on the Conceptual Captions dataset.\",\n}\n", "homepage": "http://data.statmt.org/cc-100/", "license": "", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "caption": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "url": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "conceptual_captions", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "1.1.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 623230370, "num_examples": 3318333, "dataset_name": "conceptual_captions"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 2846024, "num_examples": 15840, "dataset_name": "conceptual_captions"}}, "download_checksums": {}, "download_size": 0, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 626076394, "size_in_bytes": 626076394}}
